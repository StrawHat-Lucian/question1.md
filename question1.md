My name is Lucian Aidan Chadwin Bredenkamp. Yes, I know the name itself is long, but as I grew up, I learned to love it. I came to see what my parents saw when naming meâ€”I had so much personality and love that they had to give me two extra names ðŸ˜‚

I took a rather unconventionalâ€”or should I say uniqueâ€”approach to life, but more on that later.

I attended three different primary schools as my parents got divorced when I was young, which meant lots of moving around. It was difficult for me to adjust and make friends until my later high school years. I matriculated from Elsieâ€™s River High School in 2015 and then went on to study BCom Accounting at the University of the Western Cape.

I had a good first-year experience as I learned to come out of my shell and made a few good friends and memories. Unfortunately, my second year didnâ€™t go so well. I got sick during the year and was unable to complete some exams and courses, which resulted in me failing and having to not only delay my course but also switch degrees. It was hard for me to adjust when I returned, and it took extra time to finish my degreeâ€”Covid didnâ€™t help either.

My girlfriendâ€™s dad at the time didnâ€™t want us seeing each other unless we got married, so I decided to get married young because I was in love. This also led me into the working world, where my customer service journey began. I worked in customer service for five years and developed many skillsâ€”people skills, troubleshooting skills, communication skills, and moreâ€”that helped me grow both personally and academically. I completed my degree part-time and then joined Capitec.

After a year as a customer service agent, I was promoted to team leader. I was given a new team to develop into competent agents, and I worked as hard as I could to think outside the box and push them beyond expectations. We became the best team on the BSC.

Unfortunately, this is where my personal life took a sharp turnâ€”I got divorced. It was a struggle to get back to normal, especially as I was just joining a secondment program. But with time, I learned to be stronger and handle situations more capably, which ultimately led me to the current IMI programme.
