The first thing that caught my eye about a career in data is the salary, as I like to set tangible goals for myself. Secondly, it lines up with my degree as I will be able to develop more skills as well as more background knowledge about systems and how the systems operate to provide the results we need. I always enjoyed problem-solving and learning new things, and with the opportunity to develop further accredited skills as well as earn a salary for it, I knew it was what I wanted. When I started to learn more about Python and code in general, I started to enjoy how the data forms different outputs and the different things the data can do, and the different applications you can make with code. As the world is ever-changing, I want to adapt and move forward with it and not be left behind and become obsolete.
