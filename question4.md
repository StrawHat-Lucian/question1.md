Relevant Experience:

I wouldn’t say I have any direct experience, but I attended an Edunova boot camp for a few months in 2021. We learned to code using Scratch, and I created a few games during that time. I really enjoyed the experience and hoped I’d have the opportunity to do something similar again.

After completing the course, I visited primary schools and showed kids how to use the system as well.
