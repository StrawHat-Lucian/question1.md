How I Spend My Free Time:

Monday to Friday, the first hour after work is spent at the gym—just trying to stay healthy.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays after the gym, I like to walk my dog around the neighborhood to give him some freedom and exercise.

The rest of my weekly activities and hobbies rotate between:

Watching anime, movies, or TV shows
Playing video or mobile games
Writing music
Recording music
Playing pool with my brother while having a drink at the bar
On weekends, we like to do something we call a “bro-cation,” where we visit random places and just try to have a good time—after I’ve spent the day with my dog at the beach.
